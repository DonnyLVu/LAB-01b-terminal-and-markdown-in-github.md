1) First, you create a new repo for this while checking the box for the **README.ME**.
2) Secondly, you should copy the code by pressing on code and then save the https://github.com/ whatever you named the repo, *click on the clipboard* then switch over to your terminal.
3) Third, create the pathway  that you want the repo to get git clone into. **cd** into the pathway and use the command **git clone** and now you have the repo in your directory.
4) Fourth, **cd** into the repo directory and using **mkdir src** create the parent that would house *assests* and *index.html*.
5) Fifth, **cd** into *src* then use the command **mkdir assests**, then **touch index.html** then use **cd assets** to go into that directory.
6) Sixth,  use **touch style.css** and then **touch style.css** and **touch app.js**.
7) Seventh, **cd ..** back out to *assets* then use it again to to get it back to **src**, then use **cd **touch instructions.md** and **echo 'Hello there!' greeting.md**.
8) Eighth, use **git add -A** to ready code to be saved on GitHub, **git commit -m**(*note of what you did which should more or less follow sentence structure of "I will _____"*), Then to push it you would use **git push**.
9) Ninth, use **code .** to open up *VSCode*, go into *instruction.md* and start an instructional list of numbered bullets like above on how to to everything that has been done to do this.
10) Tenth, use step 8 once again to save everything into GitHub.
